# coffee_escapades

Fun little CV project.

The aim of this web app is to showcase LightSpeed coffee - a revolutanary way of making coffee - and tell the viewer a little more of myself.

At the moment the code is not optimized for mobile and thus not built with Responsive design principals.

The idea, design and coding took me roughly 2 days.

Have a great day!
